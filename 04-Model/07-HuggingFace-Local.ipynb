Parameters are the aspects of the model that are learned from training data; they are essentially the internal settings that determine how the model interprets and generates language.

The training process for these models involves exposing them to a diverse array of text sources, such as books, articles, and websites, allowing them to learn language patterns, grammar, facts about the world, and even styles of writing. However, it's important to note that while LLMs can provide information that seems knowledgeable, their responses are generated based on patterns in the data they were trained on and not from a sentient understanding or awareness. The development and deployment of LLMs raise important considerations regarding accuracy, bias, ethical use, and the potential impact on various aspects of society, including employment, privacy, and misinformation.
